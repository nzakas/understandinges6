ECMAScript 6 represents the biggest change to the core of JavaScript in the history of the language. Not only does the sixth edition add new object types, but also new syntax and exciting new capabilities. The result of years of study and debate, ECMAScript 6 reached feature complete status in 2014. While it will take a bit of time before all JavaScript environments support ECMAScript 6, it's still useful to understand what's coming and which features are available already.

This book is a guide for the transition between ECMAScript 5 and 6. It is not specific to any JavaScript environment, so it is equally useful to web developers as it is Node.js developers.

What you'll learn:

* All of the changes to the language since ECMAScript 5
* How the new class syntax relates to more familiar JavaScript concepts
* Why iterators and generators are useful
* How arrow functions differ from regular functions
* Additional options for storing data using sets, maps, and more
* The power of inheriting from native types
* Why people are so excited about promises for asynchronous programming
* How modules will change the way you organize code

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will the book be finished?

The book is content-complete as of June 10, 2016.

### If I buy a copy now, do I get the finished one?

Yes. When you buy the Leanpub ebook today, you will automatically get all updates for the ebook. You'll be notified of updated versions via email after purchase.

### How often is the book published?

Roughly every week or two the changes in GitHub are published to Leanpub.

### What is the state of content in GitHub?

Everything in GitHub is a work in progress. Those parts that are known to be correct and fully-formed enough to be valuable are published to Leanpub. That's why there's more content in GitHub than is available on Leanpub, as GitHub contains everything, including content that's not quite ready for the book.

### What is the difference between the print version and the Leanpub version?

The topics covered, and the order in which those topics are covered, are exactly the same between the print and Leanpub versions. The only real differences are in some words and phrases that have been altered by the copyeditors either for clarity or to follow No Starch's style guide. These changes are not backported into Leanpub because they happen on PDFs and sometimes opaquely, making it difficult to keep the two versions in sync.

### Can I acquire translation rights?

Yes. Please contact [No Starch Press](https://www.nostarch.com/) for acquiring translation rights.
